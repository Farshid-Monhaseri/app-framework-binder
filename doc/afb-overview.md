	                   AGL SYSTEM

The application and its companion binder run in secured and isolated
environment set for them. Applications are intended to access to AGL
system through the binder.

The binder afb-daemon serves multiple purposes:

1. It acts as a gateway for the application to access the system;

2. It acts as an HTTP server for serving files to HTML5 applications;

3. It allows HTML5 applications to have native extensions subject
to security enforcement for accessing hardware ressources or
for speeding parts of algorithm.
