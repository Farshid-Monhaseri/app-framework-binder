Working with afb-daemon
-----------------------



Future of afb-daemon
--------------------

- Integration of the protocol JSON-RPC for the websockets.

- The binder afb-daemon would launch the applications directly.

- The current setting of mode (local/remote/global) might be reworked to a
mechanism for querying configuration variables.

- Implements "one-shot" initial token. It means that after its first
authenticated use, the initial token is removed and no client can connect
anymore.
