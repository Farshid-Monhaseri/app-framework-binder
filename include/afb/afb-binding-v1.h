 * Function for registering the binding
 *
 * A binding V1 MUST have an exported function of name
 *
 *              afbBindingV1Register
 *
 * This function is called during loading of the binding. It
 * receives an 'interface' that should be recorded for later access to
 * functions provided by the framework.
 *
 * This function MUST return the address of a structure that describes
 * the binding and its implemented verbs.
 *
 * In case of initialisation error, NULL must be returned.
 *
 * Be aware that the given 'interface' is not fully functionnal
 * because no provision is given to the name and description
 * of the binding. Check the function 'afbBindingV1ServiceInit'
 * defined in the file <afb/afb-service-itf.h> because when
 * the function 'afbBindingV1ServiceInit' is called, the 'interface'
 * is fully functionnal.
